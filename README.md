# Hangman Java
Old coding project in which I used Java to create a hangman game.
# What I Built
- Word Bank
  - Created a list of words where the program randomly selects one word and converts it to uppercase.
- Game Logic
  - Max Attempts: Players get 5 wrong guesses before losing.
  - Tracking Guesses: You keep a string of guessed letters to prevent repeats.
  - Correct Guess Handling: If the guessed letter is in the word, you reveal it in the hidden word.
  - Incorrect Guess Handling: Wrong guesses increment a counter and reduce remaining attempts.
  - Provides feedback: “correct,” “incorrect,” or “already guessed.”
Incorrect Guess Handling: Wrong guesses increment a counter and reduce remaining attempts.
# Tools Used
